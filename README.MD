# ESOF Project | FEUP 2019/2020

## Vision

Our project aims to ease a common trouble among conferences nowadays. We want to give both the users and companies a better and easier way to interact with each other. We want to build an android app that tries to achieve this goal by allowing the various companies that attend a convention to create and share various quizzes with those that visit it.
The quizzes' main objective, besides making the player curious and actively look for the answers, is for the people to interact directly with the various companies' representatives. To further motivate the attendants to interact with the companies, the quizzes may have certain rewards attached to their completion. These rewards can only be obtained after the attendant speaks with the respective representative of the company.
