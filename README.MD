# ESOF Project | FEUP 2019/2020

## Vision
Our project aims to ease a common touble among conferences nowadays. We want to give both the users and companies a better and easier way to interact with each other. To allow that, we want to build an android app capable of interact with a database stored in a central server with information about every user and company present in the lecture. The app's goal is to indicate the occupation of the different spaces and eventually make recomendations to any user of the spaces to visit through quizzes made by the companies to the users. The app also allows the event's organizers and every company to see stats about the event as well as collect feedback and informations about the users interested.
